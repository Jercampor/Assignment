# Assignment

This project was made as a wiki for the game Helldivers 2, as such the code was made simple and standardised for replication of more data, with some pages still being a work in progress


When it comes to HTML I used sections and bootstrap for holding the information cards inside, and used bootstrap and CSS for the Navigation bar and look of the website, theres only 1 CSS and JS file which is used throughout every page

The code is similar for all pages, with the Contact, Quiz and Gallery being the most different.

All images are located inside 1 file
